# Lambda World 2025 - Match the BEA(M)T

Hi friend!

This repository contains some material to follow my workshop at Lambda World 2025 in Cadiz. If you're attending: can't wait to see you there! If you're reading this later in time: you will be able to follow it as well :)

## What's this workshop about?

It's about having fun, first of all!

I'm a passionate [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) enthusiast and love to showcase its goods (and bads) via non-trivial projects. This is one of them!

We'll setup a small, then big, then hopefully distributed band and jam together in complete chaos!

### What can I expect to learn?

This workshop is aimed to people curious about Elixir, but that didn't have the time, chance or will to play with it. We'll explore the basics, from its functional features to its pragmatic design choices and limitations, up to intermediate level features about supervision trees, distribution and libraries.

## What do I need to participate?

We'll need:

 * a computer to follow the workshop
   * if you're attending live, I encourage you to bring a headset to hear the sounds you'll create while building up the experience
 * an updated clone of [funchestra](https://github.com/zoten/funchestra)
   * if you're attending live, the repository will be made public some minutes before the workshop
   * if you're reading this later, you should find it already public :)
